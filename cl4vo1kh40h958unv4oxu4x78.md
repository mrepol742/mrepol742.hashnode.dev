It's cuztomizable, manageable, tweakable, material based design, incomparable privacy and the newly added buildin ad blockers and more buildin features. It even has its own VPN.

Having a size of 400KB makes the app the smallest yet fully featured. Currently the app can be downloaded from my website, uptodown store, amazon app store, samsung galaxy store and getjar. Soon to be available on Google Play Store.
