# Webvium

Is one of the world's smallest, privacy friendly, smart and awesome android web browser. Build and program from scratch. Webvium download size is just 400KB, perhaps making it the world's smallest android app. Yet, Webvium provides more awesome and cool features without collecting user data.

A Product of Software Engineering and Research Development. Webvium aimed to be the lightest, fastest, secured, private and full-featured android web browser and it's Free to use without any subscription or adsvertisement in the app.

I designed this from the ground up to maximize download size, performance, compatibility and quality. To make impossible, possible.

Revolutionizing Software Engineering and Development into another level. It's a challenge for me to do it and took quite a lot of efforts, decisions, mistakes and errors. I wanted to be one of the pioneers in making super one of the worlds known lightweight Android Apps.

As days, months and years passed by. Apps updates into newer version to add new functionality or to support a system. But one of the key problem is the size. They keep getting higher and higher and higher because most of the app size are from libraries or images used. It's hard at first to solved this problem without lossing features even though there's solutions online they mostly won't gonna reduce much size.

Webvium is still at its development stages the app has everything and cool feature's android web browser must have to maximize user experience. But as of now the latest version Webvium v2.8. Webvium doesn't yet support the creation of new tabs from other apps when new link is open externally and websites can't create new tab using target="_blank". The time will say when it'll be supported. But in lower version of the app it doesn't support Webvium Search and or the New Tab.

While the Research and Development are going. There's always a solution on any problems.
