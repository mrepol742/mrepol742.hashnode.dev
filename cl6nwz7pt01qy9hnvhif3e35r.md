ULTRA LIGHTWEIGHT
Since one of the logic behind this app is being programmed from scratch without using any 3rd party libraries the result was satisfying since most of the app size was occupied by 3rd party libraries. Also the webvium browser minimize the use of png and jpg instead it uses vector which makes the app a lot lighter. Having a total size of 4O0KB on the latest update perhaps makes the app the lightest of its kind on the category browsing.

NO BACKGROUND SERVICES
One of the thing that makes user phone slower is app get contants update or run services in the background even though the user doesn't use the app even though i understand the app may need to sync or do some process. Webvium doesn't run any background services when user doesn't use the app. Though it run a notification and update service once a while. Saving resources.

FULL FEATURED
Even though the current stable released doens't yet have the support for target blank and other things. Webvium is fully capable of being a web browser it has tabs, bookmarks, history, search, download, navigation controls and also tons of preferences.

MATERIAL DESIGN
The app doesn't use 3rd party libraries that means the app designed is base on the android itself customize to look material and cool. Material Design wasn't a thing now in newer android since the introductio of Material You but will soon to support it.

PRIVACY CONTROLS
Webvium browser doesn't have an ad, analytics or telemetry. It also allow users to pause history, search and downloads history. DNT (Dont Not Track) Header enabled and other privacy and security settings which you can see in the privacy and advanced section in webvium app settings.

TOOLS
Webvium has buildin tools (i.e, Headerss, NSLookup, Source Code, Robots, AssetLinks, Sitemap, Received Error, Received SSL Error, Console Panel, Console Message, Base64 Encoder and Decoder, URL Encoder and Decoder, View IP, View UA, Password Generator, Logcat). It also has Ad Blocker which is currently on development to make it better, Inspect Element to inspect page element source code without viewing the entire page source code, Design Mode to edit live text, Print the page or save it as pdf file, and also a VPN.

SOURCE CODES
The Webvium Project source code was programmed for scratch to be able to achieved satisfying output without making the app size heavier or invading user privacy by allowing 3rd party to process it. The app is capable to low in low end devices (android 5.0) 500MB RAM. Since its lightweight most of the system resources it consume are for sites.

The project has a lot more to improve and will continue improving.

The app has more to offer while having a size of 400KB. You can download it now here:
