# The Project Webvium | Behind The Scene

As time goes by, applications get heavier and heavier on every update. They also collect countless data in background not known by the user, that concerns user privacy. Developers keep bloating them with libraries, frameworks and analytics.

Developers nowadays tend to use libraries in exchange to save a few days of development cycle. Libraries help to make developers work faster but in exchange they consume most of the app total size. Example, a Hello World app built natively just sizes a few Kilobytes but using libraries a Hello World app can skyrocket to 5-10 Megabytes and a React-native built Hello World app sizes over 40 Megabytes doing nothing just displaying Hello World text on screen.

3rd Party Libraries may help make the development stage easier and faster but it also comes with a cost not just making the project app size higher but they also tend to collect data which they usually disclose as  miscellaneous but can be PII (Personally Identifiable Information). In Google Play Store alone a lot of android apps and games violate privacy whether they're lying about data collection, not properly disclosing what data they collect, how they've been processed, where it processes, and how it is disposed of.

Introducing The Project Webvium a Library and Framework less web browser that has intuitive UI based in Material Design, programmed and designed to be lighter 400KB thats 0.4MB to be exact compared to the competitors. The only privacy friendly web browser that doesnt process nor collect PII ( Personally Identifiable Information ). Engineered using the latest technology.
Considered how huge the source code of this project at 22.2K in java and 14.7K in xml, and if you already see the app used quite a large sets of icons. The project still achieved the 400KB. it supports android 5.0 to newer versions.
